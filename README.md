**Abstract: 
At the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, a number of non-pharmaceutical interventions have been implemented in order to reduce transmission, thus leading to multiple phases of transmission. The disease reproduction number R<sub>t</sub>, a way of quantifying transmissibility, has been a key part in assessing the impact of such interventions. We discuss the distinct types of transmission models used and how they are linked. We consider a hierarchical stochastic epidemic model with piece-wise constant  R<sub>t</sub>, appropriate for modelling the distinct phases of the epidemic and quantifying the true disease magnitude. The location and scale of  R<sub>t</sub> changes are inferred directly from data while the number of transmissibility phases is allowed to vary. We determine the model complexity via appropriate Poisson point process and Dirichlet process-type modelling components. The models are evaluated using synthetic data sets and the methods are applied to freely available data from California and New York states as well as the United Kingdom and Greece. We estimate the true infected cases and the corresponding  R<sub>t</sub>, among other quantities, and independently validate the proposed approach using a large seroprevalence study.
